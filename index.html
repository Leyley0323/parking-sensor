    <h1>ESP32 Parking Sensor Project</h1>

    <p>
        This is a simple real-time embedded system I built using the ESP32 and ESP-IDF v4.x. 
        The project uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance and LED/buzzer indicators 
        to warn the driver as a vehicle approaches an obstacle.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a real-time parking distance sensor built using the ESP32 microcontroller. 
        It measures distance using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and updates LED or buzzer indicators 
        as the object gets closer. Because measurements and alerts must be delivered within strict 
        timing constraints, the system qualifies as a real-time embedded application. The demo 
        shows the system responding live to distance changes.
