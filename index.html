    <h1>ESP32 Parking Sensor Project</h1>

    <p>
        This is a simple real-time embedded system I built using the ESP32 and ESP-IDF v4.x. 
        The project uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance and LED/buzzer indicators 
        to warn the driver as a vehicle approaches an obstacle.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The system measures distance in real time, updates a display/LED pattern, 
        and triggers an alert when the vehicle becomes too close. 
        This site is part of a mini-assignment to practice GitHub Pages for hosting 
        project demos and building a future portfolio.
