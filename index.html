    <h1>ESP32 Real-Time Parking Sensor Project</h1>

    <p>
        This is a simple real-time embedded system I built using the ESP32 and ESP-IDF. 
        The project measures distance using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and updates an emergency LED indicator 
        as the autonomous vehicle approaches an obstacle. Because measurements and alerts must be delivered within strict 
        timing constraints, the system qualifies as a real-time embedded application. The demo 
        shows the system responding live to distance changes.
